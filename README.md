## Future Plans

The future plans for this application include recreating it using React.js to leverage the benefits of a component-based architecture, improved performance, and easier state management. Some of the specific upgrades planned are:

1. **Modular Components**: Redesign the application using React.js to break down the UI into modular components, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

2. **Optimized Performance**: Implement efficient rendering and loading techniques to improve the overall performance of the application.

3. **State Management**: Utilize React's state management or integrate a state management library (such as Redux) to manage application-wide data and user interactions effectively.

4. **Improved Search and Filters**: Enhance the search and filtering functionality to provide a seamless user experience when browsing images and videos.

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive across different devices and screen sizes for a consistent experience.

6. **User Authentication**: Consider adding user authentication to enable users to create accounts and save their preferences and favorites.

7. **Interactive User Interface**: Implement interactive elements, such as dynamic image previews and video playback controls, to make the user interface more engaging.
